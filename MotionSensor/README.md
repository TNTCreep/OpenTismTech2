# Motion Sensor

Motion sensor uses the opencomputers Motion Sensor and sends the information to a discord channel via a webhook

Requires a direct line of sight to the player and seems to send around like every 5 ticks if it feels like it idk its kinda weird

although V1 is finished it is no where near refined by any means and has no operational gui of configuartion shit so dont get high expectations. all it does is send messages and not crash

# Motion Sens V1

Minimum Requirements

Server Version - Reccomended

- 1x EEPROM
- 1x Internet Card
- 1x Graphics Card Tier 1
- 1x CPU Tier 1
- 1x Memory Stick Tier 1.5
- 1x HDD Tier 1

OS - OpenOS

Optional Items

- Component Bus for more motion sensors

Additional info

The memory stick 1.5 isnt nescessary but it runs the program much smoother than the tier 1 version so you might aswell its not too expensive compared to the weaker version

Computer Verison - Not Reccomended

- 1x Computer Case Tier 2
- 1x Monitor Tier 2
- 1x APU Tier 2
- 1x Internet Card
- 1x Memory Tier 2
- 1x HDD Tier 2
- 1x EEPROM

OS - OpenOS

Additional Info

This is really if u dont want to use a server for some reason and this will technically run smoother than its tier 1 server counterpart but is far more expensive because for some reason the Tier 1 Computer doesnt like the Motion_Sensor part of the code
