# CELL-FS
Cell-File System

Cell-FS is a graphical file management system for personal computers and servers allowing ease of access for even the most braindead people right now it is currently in beta with various bugs like clicking the bottom left of the screen will crash the app and require u to kill it via CTRL-ALT-C but there is nothing to click there anyway so dw you have to misclick really badly to actually press it or be fucking around to begin with so yeah its pretty much fully functional except for copying and pasting. but its pretty cool and useful i'd say.

# Requirements

NO TIER 1 COMPUTER CAN RUN THIS

Tier 2 setup - you can skip the APU part if ur using a server - these use the minimum requirements so you can always upgrade with no problem :D

- 1x Computer Case Tier 2
- 1x Monitor Teir 2
- 1x CPU Tier 2
- 1x APU Tier 2
- 1x Memory Tier 2
- 1x HDD Tier 2
- 1x Internet Card
- 1x EEPROM
- 1x Graphics Card Tier 2
- 1x Disk Drive

- OS - OpenOS

Additional info

when installing on a computer (not server) the computer cant fit both graphics and internet card so u must use a APU and internet card to download but switch the APU out for a CPU and internet card for a graphics card as the APU's graphics are not powerful enough to run the program as it has the same power graphically as the tier 1 card which as you could probably guess cant run it. if you are using a server u wont have this issue cuz it has higher tier slots.

Tier 2 pc's have slight graphic issues that dont affect usuability but makes it look a bit fucked up so if u dont mind it and want a cheaper alternative than the Tier 3 just use tier 2

Tier 3 Setup - Reccomended

- 1x Computer Case Tier 3
- 1x Monitor Tier 3
- 1x Graphics card Tier 3
- 1x Memory Tier 3
- 1x EEPROM
- 1x Internet card
- 1x HDD Tier 3
- 1x CPU Tier 3

- OS - Open OS

Additional Info

you could use the tier 3 APU but it will give you the same graphical issues as the tier 2 graphics card so not realy any point if ur running the teir 3 i suppose

# Installation

paste in pc - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TNTCreep/OpenTismTech1/refs/heads/main/Cell-FS/installer.lua installer.lua
